Welcome to the U.S. States Game! This is an interactive Python game where you can test your knowledge of U.S. states. Using Turtle graphics and pandas, the game challenges players to guess all 50 states of the USA. The goal is to name all states correctly and see them appear on a map.


Features

State Guessing: Players input state names to see them appear on the map.

Score Tracking: Keeps track of the player's score.

Missing States: Exits the game and saves the names of any unguessed states to a CSV file.
